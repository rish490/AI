Pseudocode Implementation
# Step 1: Documents
documents = [
  "Top 10 coding interview tips",
  "How to cook pasta",
  "Guide to system design interviews",
  "Travel checklist for Paris"
]

# Step 2: Generate embeddings using a model
embeddings = [embedding_model.encode(doc) for doc in documents]

# Step 3: Build an ANN index
index = ANNIndex()   # e.g., FAISS, Milvus, or HNSW-based
for i, vector in enumerate(embeddings):
    index.add(id=i, vector=vector)

index.build()  # constructs internal graph/clusters

# Step 4: Query phase
query = "How to prepare for a software engineering interview"
query_vec = embedding_model.encode(query)

# Step 5: Find top similar documents
  #this is very similar to traditional indexing algos like Approximate Nearest Neighbor is used which mostly calculates cosine similarities performance optimisation is done via indexing only for ex 
  # Build Clusters (during indexing)
  
  Before searching, ANN groups vectors into clusters of similar points:
  
  Cluster	Vectors	Meaning
  Cluster A	D1, D2, D5, D6	Pets/Animals (vectors near (1,1)–(2,2))
  Cluster B	D3, D4, D7, D8	Finance (vectors near (9,9)–(11,11))


results = index.search(query_vec, top_k=2)

# Step 6: Return results
for id, similarity in results:
    print(f"Document: {documents[id]} | Similarity: {similarity}")


Output Example:

Document: Top 10 coding interview tips | Similarity: 0.998
Document: Guide to system design interviews | Similarity: 0.995
